# CS300DSA

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
 - The project resolved around creating algorithms and a data structure to hold, sort, and display (along with a few other functions) course data for multiple courses in a CS path for the advisory team at ABC University.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
 - I approached the problem that held the courses in a tree, designing sorting on insertion and ease of traversal for retrieval.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
 - My method for programming is to code little bits at a time and run tests on both the individual functions I write and then once I know they work, compounding tests on how they interact with the system as a whole to ensure a seamless program (as far as functionality). When I encounter problems during this testing, I always start back at the beginning of this iteration (all previous iterations of the testing should still be good) and run through it to make sure that the logic is sound, if errors are found I run the tests again and repeat.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
 - This project has taught me to think in algorithms and add them (known and self-authored) into my programs to enhance them. It has also taught me several useful data structures that I can use to hold data and the benefits (and pitfalls) of each, as well as the algorithms to manipulate the data in ways that lays a foundation for writing more to operate on the data in different ways.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
 - This project was the first time I have used a struct{} block in a program that I wrote which granted me the opportunity to familiarize myself with that concept and piecing that into the overall system. This course also taught me how to think bigger about algorithms and has, with this skill assisted me with a script I am writing for work. It has taught me algorithms that I can implement into my future projects to simplify them.
